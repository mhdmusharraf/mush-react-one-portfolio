          Third-year computer engineering student, future full stack web

          Currently, I focus on installing and testing user interface elements
          on responsive websites. I typically use HTML/CSS , JavaScript and
          ReactJS in the client, Node.js on the server, and http for
          communication between client and server. <br />
          <br />
          ðŸŒŸ Let's connect! I'm excited about opportunities to contribute to
          impactful projects and collaborate with teams passionate about pushing
          the boundaries of web development.
